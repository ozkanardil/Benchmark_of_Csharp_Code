# Benchmark Project
This project is designed to compare the performance of key structures and concepts in C#. The project includes console applications for each benchmark that performs a series of tests, measuring the execution time and resource consumption.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of C# programming and the .NET Framework. You'll also need to have Visual Studio installed on your machine.

# Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Benchmark.sln file in Visual Studio.
Build the solution by selecting Build Solution from the Build menu.
Run the console application by selecting Start from the Debug menu.
Running the Tests
The console application included in this project runs a series of tests on classes and structs. Each test measures the execution time and resource consumption of a particular operation. The results of each test are displayed in the console output.

To run the tests, simply select the startup project and run the console application. The application will automatically run the test/tests and display the results in the console output.
